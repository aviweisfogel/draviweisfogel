It's verifying what I can do in addition to what their doctor might or may not be telling. I just got self-confidence in my capabilities. Listening to what others are doing and believing this is right. If I do it by doing this, I understand that I can succeed. I know that I can reach my objectives and I can help others while doing so. It's tough to make that jump as a dentist due to the fact that we are bombarded with numerous things we can do to be successful. What I have actually seen with this program is helping me achieve not just my financial goals but my personal objectives too. I've been doing the dentistry for a long period of time and my objective is to be able to step away from doing dentistry and this is offering me the opportunity to learn how to do that and end up being an effective business owner. It's succeeding and has the assistance of all the other members."-- Dr. Dana Blalock</font><br><br><font size="4"><center><iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;" src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/394448/62066588" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="220" width="420"></iframe></center><br>It's providing me the business abilities to take the education info that I had about sleep apnea to be able to help patients and put the process together. My greatest aha minute existed is a various way to bring in clients. I don't need to simply rely on my clients in the workplace but I can broaden that function to assist other workplaces screen and grow this much larger than what I expected. I'm probably among the most hesitant people. Like a great deal of dentists, our companied believe that we strove, we will investigate, I want to very methodically take a look at what I'm doing, I finally got to a point where I stated I want to grow. I wish to utilize the skills that I obtained from 2 to 3 other programs. I know the abilities, I understand how to do it and I want to utilize those abilities. For me, it was a leap of faith. I wish to try something outside my convenience zone, I'm going to put my 100% and I'm going to make it work."
