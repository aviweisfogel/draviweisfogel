Dr. Avi Weisfogel, in a recent interview, describes how The International Academy of Sleep is motivating dental experts to treat sleep apnea through telemedicine.<br><br>COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has affected all service sectors, consisting of dental sleep medicine. This unfortunate time has called all health sectors to work hand-in-hand to attend to not just the coronavirus itself however the terrible impacts it might bring to people and their total wellness.<br><br>The world is handling increased fear and stress and anxiety, not just to those at higher dangers such as the senior population and immune-compromised patients, but to people of any ages. Organisations are closing down; social gatherings are extremely dissuaded, home quarantine is strictly encouraged, and, obviously, the requirement to preserve appropriate hygiene-- hand cleaning and all. How long will the circumstance resemble this is a concern that nobody can answer as of the minute.<br><br>Business sectors in health care have had to adjust to the changes, which is exactly what The International Academy of Sleep is doing in their industry.<H3>Avi Weisfogel, Sleep Apnea Treatment and Dental Sleep Medicine</H3>Just Recently Dr. Avi Weisfogel from the International Academy of Sleep was included on a radio show sponsored by Calmness Sleep Listen to this helpful interview with Avi Weisfogel for more information about how dental sleep medicine is crucial for individuals suffering from sleep apnea.<br><br>Now, more than ever, is the time to look after one's health, and one method of doing so is to have an appropriate sleep. With enough sleep, the body's cytokine level is increased, a kind of protein responsible for targeting swelling and infections, therefore, keeping the body immune system in great shape. Such proteins are produced and launched during sleep, and without sufficient sleep, one could be a simple target of infection, consisting of the dreadful coronavirus 2019 illness.<br><br>Individuals in dental sleep medicine are concerned that lots of sleep patients would overlook their health because of their fear of contracting the infection. Social distancing is practiced as a method of restricting the spread of the virus, but ensuring adequate sleep is essential too. However, sound sleep is difficult to come by for individuals with sleep apnea and other sleep-related conditions.<br><br>The International Academy of Sleep understands the dilemma that sleep patients are currently facing. It is a problem not just by sleep patients but by oral sleep specialists too. Provided the existing health situation, individuals would be reluctant to come to the dental sleep workplace for treatment. The telemedicine method is now practiced to alleviate the effect of COVID-19 on the clients and the sleep centers. It is a method of constantly offering service and care to patients and, at the same time, restricting contagion without compromising patient care.<br><br>From an organisation viewpoint, oral sleep specialists can still practice and run their service without the need to be physically present. A telemedicine portal helps with health check-ups without the need to be physically there, therefore, restricting the danger of COVID-19 transmission. The telemedicine approach of care is not new, as numerous have been using it, although very few clients are getting used to it. The whole world is in a health crisis, and the current situation calls everybody to come up with a way to innovate companies, especially health sectors and e-commerce, in general.<br><br>Telemedicine is better than avoiding sleep testing entirely. Although, for the time being, services are in the form of telemedicine, felt confident that clients will still get first-class health services. The emphasis is placed on patient education, particularly about the risk-mitigation approaches to prevent the repercussions of neglected and unmanaged sleep apnea and other related sleep disorders. All advised treatments should be continually observed in the house, such as positional therapy, weight management, managing nasal congestion, and using the dental appliance.<H3>About The International Academy of Sleep</H3>The International Academy of Sleep is an organization that undertakings to spread out awareness and understanding of this typical and mostly undiagnosed and neglected sleep disorder.<br><br>Through our educational resources, IAOS makes every effort to educate the public on sleep apnea, its models, signs, threat factors and treatments.
