Oral devices range from simple prosthetics placed in the mouth throughout sleep to avoid the tongue from blocking the respiratory tract, to using CPAP, continuous positive air passage pressure. CPAP utilizes a medical pump, attached to versatile tubing, which is connected to a mask that fits over the nose, or mouth or both. Via this mask, the CPAP pumps a stream of air into the mouth throughout sleep to keep the respiratory tract open.</font><br><br><font size="4">Other sleep apnea remedies include taste buds (roof of the mouth) stiffening. Insertions of polyester product into the taste buds minimize vibration. Scarring, too, can stiffen the palate, achieved by injecting a scarring option (injection snoreplasty), utilizing a laser, or surgical treatment to produce the scarring.</font><br></div><font size="4"><br><a href="https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/09/25/184331">https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/09/25/184331</a><br><br><a href="https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/09/25/190834">https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/09/25/190834</a><br><br><a href="https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/09/25/192201">https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/09/25/192201</a><br><br><a href="https://www.scoop.it/topic/dr-avi-weisfogel-dds/p/4110782449/2019/09/25/sleep-apnea-syndrome-remedies">https://www.scoop.it/topic/dr-avi-weisfogel-dds/p/4110782449/2019/09/25/sleep-apnea-syndrome-remedies</a><br><br></font><center><font size="4"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/327590075" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="347" width="750"></iframe></font></center><div align="justify"><font size="4"><br>Air passage broadening through tissue reduction is yet another of the sleep apnea solutions. Radiofrequency Tissue Reduction (RFTR) involves piercing the tongue, soft palate or throat using a needle linked to a radio frequency generator. The inner tissues diminish, however external tissues, those that contain palate, remain unaffected.</font><br><br><font size="4">The most invasive sleep apnea treatments are surgical procedures. Uvulopalatoplasty is a treatment that can shrink or get rid of the uvula (that tissue that hangs from the roofing of the mouth in the back of the throat). Nasal surgical treatment includes aligning the septum (the barrier in between the nostrils) in clients where nasal congestion makes complex the sleep apnea. In addition, a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy might be performed to broaden the air passage.</font><br></div><font size="4"><br></font><center><font size="4"><iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;" src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/394448/60201208" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="220" width="420"></iframe></font></center><font size="4"></font><font size="4"><br>The most intrusive of sleep apnea solutions, is a surgery called Maxillomandibular improvement (MMA). Mixed Martial Arts is performed just in the most tough cases. It involves removing the upper and lower jaw, moving them forward and reattaching them with pins or plates.</font><br><div align="justify"><font size="4"><br></font><font size="4">Sleep position adjustment is another of the non-invasive sleep apnea treatments. Avoid sleeping on the back; instead sleep on the stomach or on the side. Sleeping on the back enables the tongue to relax toward the back of the throat, obstructing the air passage. Turning to the side and remaining there can help avoid obstruction occurring. Utilizing pillows to prop the head can likewise assist, as can a difficult item, such as a tennis ball propped behind the back to avoid rolling over throughout sleep.</font><br></div><div align="center"><font size="4"><br><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/aviweisfogel/Dr-Avi-Weisfogel-Helps-To-Control-Sleep-Apnea.html">Dr. Avi Weisfogel Helps Control Sleep Apnea</a><br><br><a href="https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/?page=1569406114">https://draviweisfogel.hatenablog.com/?page=1569406114</a></font><br></div><br>
